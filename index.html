                Hello, I'm Long Luu, a Senior Data Scientist at AstraZeneca. My works are contributing to the emerging field of Digital Health, 
                which applies the state-of-the-art digital technology and artificial intelligence to revolutionize
                healthcare and medicine. My main line of research is on remote patient monitoring which facilitates continuous tracking of patients'
                health throughout the day at the comfort of their homes (e.g. step count as illustrated <a href="#projects"> Projects</a> section).
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Before joining AstraZeneca, I had been conducting several research projects at academic insitutions. During my postdoctoral and 
                doctoral years, I studied human decision-making and visual perception using computer-controlled behavioral experiments and machine learning.
                Before that, my research works focus mostly on the field of computer vision and biomedical imaging.

                    programming languages. I used to learn languages as rare as dinosaur (Assembly, VHDL, Verilog). Early in my career, I mostly used
                    <span class="bold">Matlab</span> and <span class="bold">C++</span> to develop computer vision software and perform experiments. More recently, I mainly

                    As a trained scientist, I also have considerable experience in performing advanced <span class="bold">statistical analyses</span>
                     and <span class="bold">hypothesis testing</span> to draw actionable and deep insights from complex data

                        several state-of-the-art neural network models including InceptionV3 and InceptionResnetV2). I show that we can obtain 
                        very high performance when using a pretrained InceptionV3 network and further tuning on a subset of the image.

                        models). This work reveals a unifying principle behind many of human irrational decisions: we tend to keep consistency
                        across our decisions so that any subsequent decisions are biased to be consistent with the preceding ones even when it is
                        highly irrational. You can read the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/33334">technical paper</a> or
